Make the indicators circular insted of rectangular?
    -change these files: bootstrap.css, bootstrap.css.map,
        bootstrap.min.css, bootstrap.min.css.map, carousel.scss
            ->  width: 10px;
                height: 10px;
                border-radius: 50%;   <-add these to .css 
            ->  border-radius: $carousel-indicator-border-radius;
                <-add this to scss
        in carousel-indicators li class.

Remove the circling of carousel slides?
    -we can use wrap={false} as props in carousel tag. But, this somewhat
     disturbes the animation of transit between the slides.
    -so I have done it like this(this will retain the animations)
        ->previous handel function:
            handleSelect(selectedIndex, e) {
                this.setState({
                index: selectedIndex,
                direction: e.direction,
            });
            }   <-
        ->new handel function:
            handleSelect(selectedIndex, e) {
                if(selectedIndex === 2 && e === 'prev'){
                  selectedIndex = 0;
                  e = "";
                }
                else if(selectedIndex === 0 && e === 'next'){
                  selectedIndex = 2;
                  e = "";
                }
                this.setState({
                  index: selectedIndex,
                  direction: e.direction,
                });
                // console.log(selectedIndex,e);
            }       <-

The selectedIndex and e in handleSelect function?
    -selectedIndex contains the index to which the slide is changed.
    -e contains the method by which that slide is reached(i.e prev or next).

Making the slides go in vertical direction?
    -change bootstrap.css
        ->the translateX property is one which makes the slides go in X-direction.
          So changeing it to translateY for classes related to carousel will make it
          go in Y-diretion insted i.e. vertical.  <-
        ->for more reference https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/transform-function/translateX  <-

Non compatibility between react-bootstrap's ButtonToolbar,CardContent and MaterialUI's
calander?
    -Apparently there are some conflicts between ButtonToolbar and Material's calander.
     This might be a wrong speculation but as we included calander in our project, we 
     first added it in a card and CardContent. This made our website hang, also when I
     tried to add ButtonToolbar in Button(Book a Table), this made npm start(basically npm)
     non auto reloadable. After ButtonToolbar tag was removed everything was back to
     normal. Also our website's load time has increased after inclusion of calander. Mybe
     it is because other ButtonToolbar or CardContent tags in code. After everything is set
     we will remove them and see the result.
